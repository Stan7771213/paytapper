## Short message (chat / messenger)

Hi! 👋  
I’ve set up Paytapper for you — it’s a simple way for customers to leave tips by scanning a QR code.

You’ll get:
- A personal payment link
- A QR code
- A dashboard with all your payments

No app is needed for your customers.

Your personal dashboard:
https://paytapper.net/client/YOUR_CLIENT_ID/dashboard

I recommend doing a quick €1 test payment first to make sure everything works.
After that, you can start using it with real customers.

If you have any questions, just let me know 🙂

## In-person explanation (30 seconds)

“At the end of a tour or service, you can show this QR code.
Customers scan it and can leave a tip by card or Apple Pay.
You can see all payments in your dashboard.
It’s simple and works immediately.”

## What NOT to explain (important)

- Do not mention technical details
- Do not explain Stripe unless asked
- Do not talk about ‘test’ or ‘live’ modes
- Keep it simple and friendly

Paytapper works best when it feels natural and effortless.
