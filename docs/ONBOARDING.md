# Paytapper — Client Onboarding

This short guide helps you start accepting tips with Paytapper in just a few minutes.

Paytapper is built for guides, drivers, and creators.  
Your customers don’t need an app — they simply open a link or scan a QR code.

---

## 1) What Paytapper does

Paytapper lets people send you tips or small payments using:
- a personal payment link
- a QR code that opens the same link

Payments are processed by **Stripe** (cards, Apple Pay, Google Pay).

You get:
- a personal dashboard
- clear payment history
- automatic fee calculation
- CSV exports

---

## 2) What you need

Before you start:
- a phone or computer
- an email address
- **no Stripe account required upfront**  
  (you’ll connect it during setup)

---

## 3) Your dashboard (starting point)

Your Paytapper dashboard is the main control center.

Dashboard URL:
https://paytapper.net/client/YOUR_CLIENT_ID/dashboard

From the dashboard you can:
- open your public tip page
- copy your tip link
- download a QR code (PNG)
- connect Stripe to receive payouts
- view recent payments and reports

---

## 4) Your public tip page

Your public tip page looks like this:
https://paytapper.net/tip/YOUR_CLIENT_ID

This is the page your guests see.

You can:
- open it in a new tab
- share the link
- show or print the QR code

The page supports:
- fixed tip amounts
- custom amounts
- secure Stripe checkout

---

## 5) First test payment (recommended)

Before sharing Paytapper publicly, make a test payment yourself.

1. Open your tip page
2. Send a small amount (for example €1)
3. After payment, you’ll see a **receipt page**
4. Open your dashboard and confirm:
   - the payment appears
   - gross, fee, and net amounts are correct

If the receipt says “Processing”, wait a few seconds or refresh once.

---

## 6) Stripe connection (required for payouts)

To receive money on your bank account, you must connect Stripe.

From your dashboard:
1. Click **“Connect Stripe to receive payouts”**
2. You’ll be redirected to Stripe
3. Complete the onboarding steps
4. Return to Paytapper — your status will update automatically

Paytapper **never stores** your card or banking details.

---

## 7) Fees and transparency

- Platform fee: **10%**
- Fees are calculated automatically
- You always see:
  - Gross amount
  - Platform fee
  - Net amount

No hidden fees.

---

## 8) TEST vs LIVE mode

Paytapper supports two modes:

**TEST mode**
- Used for setup and testing
- Payments are not real

**LIVE mode**
- Used for real customers and real payments

Your dashboard always shows which mode is active.

Only share your tip link publicly when LIVE mode is enabled.

---

## 9) Best practices

- Show the QR code at the end of the service
- Say something simple, for example:  
  “If you’d like to leave a tip, you can scan this QR code”
- Keep it visible but not intrusive
- One QR works everywhere (phone, print, web)

---

## 10) If something doesn’t look right

- Wait a few seconds and refresh the page
- Check the dashboard status
- Make sure Stripe is connected
- Try a small test payment again

Paytapper is designed to be simple, transparent, and reliable.
